# 360-Pong-Game

http://apps.introcs.com/danielkoenig/comp80h-game/game.html 

360° Pong is a game I created using TypeScript, JavaScript and Html. 
In this game balls are fired at the center paddle in a random order, 
increasing in speed as your score counter increases. 
The user is able to rotate the center paddle either to the left, 
or right in order to align with the ball and reflect it back. 
The game works through desktop and phone browsers. Left, 
right arrow keys and ‘p’ key are bound to rotate the paddle left, 
right, and to start game following a loss respectively. 
When accessing the game through a smart device, 
orientation of the paddle can be change by rotating around the y axis and 
the game can be started following a loss by tapping anywhere on the screen. 
The 3rd party plugins I used were Pixi JS for the graphics, 
Howler JS for the spatial audio and Google Chrome web API for 
the smartphone orientation and touch events.
