Instructions:
* Open the link found below using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox from a Desktop or Smartphone
* Use [<] and [>] to rotate the paddle (Desktop Browser) | Hold device flat, face up and rotate device around Y-axis (Smarphone Browser)
* Face the paddle into the oncoming ball to bounce it back and increment the score
* Speed of the ball increases as the score becomes higher
* Upon failing, the game will be paused. To resume, press [p] (Desktop Browser) | tap the screen (Smartphone Browser) 

Code:
* Layout of canvas is in HTML and CSS
* Game is written in TypeScript using Pixi JS creation engine
* Spatial sound is achieved using Howler JS 3rd party plugin
* Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox smartphone API is used to handle smartphone events

Bugs/Future Improvements:
* As the speed of incoming balls increases, the sound is not calibrated to increase at the same frequency
* Smartphone orientation event is not correctly calibrated with the location of the spatial sound, giving incorrect audio guidance when used using a smarphone browser
